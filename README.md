# spotify-api

Playing around with some more "foundamentalist" concepts of object oriented
programming and trying to develop an object oriented Spotify Web API using
OAuth2 and stuff.

This ia a work-in-progress, somewhat influenced by jcabi-github.

An example of what works can be found [here](https://github.com/caarlos0/spotify-api/blob/master/src/test/java/com/carlosbecker/spotify/Example.java).
